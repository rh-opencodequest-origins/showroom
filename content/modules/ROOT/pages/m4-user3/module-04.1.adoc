<div class="pe">

Create a new software Component and supporting infrastructure using the *OpenCodeQuest - AI-Infused application with Quarkus* template that was created by the platform engineer:

NOTE: This template has been generated by an AI. Use it carefully ;)

== Explore the Template
. Access https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"].
. Click the *Create* icon (plus symbol) in the top menu.

. Oups! This is a template generated by an *amazing over-trained AI model*.. Hopefully, you are smart enough to correct the work done by the dummy AI!

. In Step 1, "Prompt me something". Yes, it's not relevant at all 
 * OpenShift version is not useful to onboard a developer. You should modify the template


== Update the Template with a human touch!

. Click on the 3 dots button as shown in the picture.
+

Remember, Templates imported previously are located in GitLab. We will directly edit it and commit it!

   *Prompt me something* by *OpenShift Cluster URL*


. Scroll down and enter a commit message `feat: change application title`.
. Click the *Commit changes* button.

Templates are refreshed asynchronously by Red Hat Developer Hub. We will see how to refresh it manually.

== Let's find the template to refresh!

. Step *1* - Click on *Catalog*
. Step *2* - Select *Template* type
. Step *3* - Click on the template *OpenCodeQuest - AI-Infused application with Quarkus* : - the name could be different from the screenshot image:/m3/template-location-steps.png[Customizing the Title]
image:/m3/template-location-steps.png[Customizing the Title]


=== Refresh it!

NOTE: The template definition is tied to its definition in the git repository. No GitOps mechanism involved here.

== Summary

Nice work! You have created a new Component and have associated source code from a Software Template.

Let's test it!
