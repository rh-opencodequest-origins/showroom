As we wid to edit template previously to correct a title, we will do it again ! 
This flow is a new part of the development lifecycle. Platform engineer share the knowledge about project development on-boarding with developers !


. Access https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"].
. Click the *Create* icon (plus symbol) in the top menu.

. Click the *Choose* button on the *OpenCodeQuest - Quarkus microservice with Spring MVC and Spring Data*. The Template parameters collection screen will be displayed.

*Explore steps definition*

Our template mission is to onboard a developer with the right resources to start inside a Gitlab Repo and deploy its work seamessly. 
Accomplish low-value tasks for developers behalf the ops team in the right way

Remember, the platform engineering helps developers to integrate development tools configured seamessly in a project. To do so, we rely on plugins to do the job. it proposes a set of *actions*

*Gitlab step definition*

For instance, to create a simple Gitlab repository, we use the concept of *action*    

```yaml
 - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
      input:
        repoUrl: "${{ parameters.repo.host }}.${{ parameters.openshiftCluster }}?owner=${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}&repo=${{parameters.component_id}}"
        repoVisibility: public
```
The *repoUrl* is built with informations set in the form. The repository will be created with in Gitlab user space *user.entity.metadata.name* and the repository name will be *component_id* set in the Java Package Information section


*Explore the Software Catalog AKA catalog-info.yaml*


As the platform engineering is the entrypoint for project developments, get the right overview of objects created, integrations performed is paramount !
This is why the *Sofware Catalog* exists ! A clear definition of UI elements based on external tools involved in the development project. For instance, pipeline status, source code repositories, registry shortcuts ...

```yaml
 - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        repoContentsUrl: ${{ steps.publish.output.repoContentsUrl }}
        catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
```
The template creates a *Software Catalog* thanks to this action in the git repository where your project will live. It will be updatable by developers. We will see how later ..

== Refresh the template updated

Templates are refreshed asynchronously by Red Hat Developer Hub. We will see how to refresh it manually.

*Let's find the template to refresh !*

. Step *1* - Click on *Catalog*
. Step *2* - Select *Template* type
. Step *3* - Choose the template  *OpenCodeQuest - Quarkus microservice with Spring MVC and Spring Data* to refresh

== Summary

Nice work! The template is definetly ready to be used ! 
Let's developer consume it !
