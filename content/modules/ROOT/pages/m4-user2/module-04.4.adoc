Create a new software Component and supporting infrastructure using the *OpenCodeQuest - Quarkus microservice with Spring MVC and Spring Data* template that was created by the platform engineer:

We will create the villain service from a Developer Hub template. It will instantiate the following tools for the project :

* Gitlab repositiory
* IDE Cloud with toolkit and runtimes
* Building pipelines
* Container image repository
* GitOps flows

== Run the Template

. Click the *Create* icon (plus symbol) in the top menu.
+

. Click the *Choose* button on the *OpenCodeQuest - Quarkus microservice with Spring MVC and Spring Data*. The Template parameters collection screen will be displayed.
. In Step 1, set the right OpenShift Cluster and let the default variables
. In Step 2, you'll be prompted to enter a set of application parameters and choose the *System"* and the *"entity"*. Thankfully, application parameters are set.
. Pick the right *System* according to your team *{team-id}*. In our example, the team is team1

. In Step 3, select the default *Repository Location*. In this case, we just have GitLab available, so you can't change this.
+
NOTE: Your username is automatically determined by the Template using your current session.
+
. Click *Review*.
+
. Confirm you're satisfied with your parameters and click *Create*. These will be passed to the scaffolder when it runs the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/opencodequest-templates/-/blob/main/scaffolder-templates/quarkus-with-spring-postgresql/template.yaml?ref_type=heads[steps defined in the template, window="gitlab"].
