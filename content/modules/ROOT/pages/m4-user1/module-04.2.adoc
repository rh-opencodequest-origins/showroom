. Click the *Choose* button on the *OpenCodeQuest - Quarkus CRUD microservice*. The Template parameters collection screen will be displayed.
. In Step 1, Set the right OpenShift Cluster and let  default variables
. In Step 2, you'll be prompted to enter a set of application parameters and choose the *System"* and the *"entity"* . Thankfully, application parameters are set.
. Pick the right *System* according to your team *{team-id}* . In our example, the team is team1

. In Step 3, select the default *Repository Location*. In this case we just have GitLab available so you can't change this.
+
NOTE: Your username is automatically determined by the Template using your current session.
+
. Click *Review*.
+
. Confirm you're satisfied with your parameters and click *Create*. These will be passed to the scaffolder when it runs the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/opencodequest-templates/-/blob/main/scaffolder-templates/quarkus-postgresql/template.yaml?ref_type=heads[steps defined in the template, window="gitlab"].
