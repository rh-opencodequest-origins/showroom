*Debug stuck deployment*

The problem is the deployment of Red Hat Developer Hub has been performed on a cluster node different from the initial storage (PVC) location. 
To fix it, we will trigger a new deployment.
To do so, go to  https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/topology/ns/rhdh-{team-id}/deployments/rhdh-{team-id}-developer-hub/yaml[backstage project on OpenShift^, window="console"].

* Search for `replicas` in the yaml file 
* Set it to 0

* Click on Save at the left bottom

Automatically, the deployment will be relaunched by OpenShift GitOps !

Congrats, you have fixed the Developer Hub deployment. Come back to your work
