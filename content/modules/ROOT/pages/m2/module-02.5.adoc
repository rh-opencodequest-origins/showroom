= Activity: Configure OpenID Connect Authentication

include::../style.adoc[]

{product_name_rhdh} supports four authentication providers:

* Guest (suitable for experimentation and demos only)
* OpenID Connect
* GitHub
* Microsoft Azure

In this activity, you'll configure an OpenID Connect authentication provider - this will enable developers within your organization to log in using their single sign-on (SSO) credentials.


== Configure the OpenID Connect Authentication Provider

. Visit your https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/developer-hub-config/[developer-hub-config repository on GitLab, window="gitlab"].
. Open the *values.yaml* file, then select *Edit > Edit single file*.
. Locate the `appConfig.auth` object in the YAML. You can search for `--- AUTHENTICATION ---` in this file to locate this section.
. Delete the existing `auth` configuration that contains the `guest` provider.
. Uncomment the entire `auth` configuration containing the `oidc` provider, and the `signInPage` setting below it.

. The end result will look similar to:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
auth:
  session:
    secret: ${BACKEND_SECRET}
  environment: production
   providers:
   oidc:
   production:
   prompt: auto
   metadataUrl: https://sso.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/realms/backstage/.well-known/openid-configuration
   clientId: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}
   clientSecret: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}
   signIn:
   resolvers:
   - resolver: preferredUsernameMatchingUserEntityName
signInPage: oidc
----

. This is an example standard Backstage `auth` configuration. Below is a summary of what this configuration specifies:
* Enable sessions, and use the `BACKEND_SECRET` environment variable to sign sessions.
* Set the authentication `environment` to `production`. Environments can have any arbitrary name.
* Enable the OpenID Connect provider (`providers.oidc`) with the following configuration:
** Provide a `production` configuration (corresponding to the `environment` defined previously).
** Use the `backstage` Realm (`metadataUrl`).
** Load the `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables (loaded from the precreated https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/rhdh-{team-id}/secrets/oauth-client[*oauth-client*] Secret, specified in `extraEnvVarsSecrets` in the _values.yaml_)
** Map any signing-in user identity to a User Entity in {product_name_rhdh} using the specified https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver/[resolver^, window="console"]. These Users and Groups have already been synchronised to the catalog due to your work in the prior module.
* The `signInPage` property is specific to {product_name_rhdh}. It ensures the correct sign-in UI is rendered. In upstream Backstage, this requires React code changes.

. Commit the changes with a message similar to `feat: enable openid connect`
. Click Refresh on the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-{team-id}[`RHDH` Application in OpenShift GitOps^, window="argo"]. If prompted, log in as `{pe-username}/{common_password}`.

. Choose  *rhsso* as the identity provider

. Wait until the Application reports being in a *Healthy* state.

== Login using OpenID Connect Authentication

. Once the latest version of your `appConfig` has been synchronized and rolled out, visit your https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[{product_name_rhdh} instance^, window="rhdh"]. You will be prompted to sign in using OpenID Connect.
+

. Log in using the username `{pe-username}` and password `{common_password}` in the pop-up that appears. After logging in, visit the *Settings* page in {product_name_rhdh} to confirm you're logged in as the `{pe-username}` user.
