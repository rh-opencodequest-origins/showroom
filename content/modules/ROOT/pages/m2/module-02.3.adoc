= {product_name_rhdh} Deployment

== Deploying {product_name_rhdh}

Platform Engineers can deploy {product_name_rhdh} on OpenShift using the Operator or Helm Chart. Both of these installation methods are outlined in the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.6/html/installing_red_hat_developer_hub_on_openshift_container_platform/index#assembly-install-rhdh-ocp-helm[{product_name_rhdh} documentation^, window="content"]. In this lab, you’ll use the Helm Chart to deploy and manage your instance of {product_name_rhdh}. The source code for this Helm Chart can be found at https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/tree/main/charts/redhat/redhat/redhat-developer-hub[openshift-helm-charts repository on GitHub^, window="content"].

== Using GitOps to Manage {product_name_rhdh}

The instance of OpenShift Container Platform used in this workshop environment has been preconfigured with OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD). Your deployment of {product_name_rhdh} is kept up to date using a GitOps workflow, as illustrated below.

NOTE: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops[GitOps] is the practice of automating application deployment using Git repositories as the "source of truth" for an https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac[infrastructure as code (IaC)] for the deployment configuration. The Git repository contains declarative configuration, typically in YAML format, that describes the desired deployment state, and a GitOps tool such as OpenShift GitOps ensures the application is deployed according to the configuration. Drifts from the configuration can automatically be patched.

Since this isn’t a GitOps-focused workshop, we’ve set up the basic GitOps workflow ahead of time. Specifically, we’ve pre-created a https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-{team-id}[rhdh-bootstrap Application in OpenShift GitOps, window="argo"] - you can view this by clicking the link and logging in as the {pe-username} user with the password `{common_password}`.

The  Argo CD Application creates Secrets, ConfigMaps, and another Argo CD Application named https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-{team-id}-bootstrap[]. The https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/applications/rhdh-{team-id}[ArgoCD, window="argo"] Argo CD Application deploys {product_name_rhdh} using the Helm Chart. The configuration values passed to the Helm Chart are sourced from the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[rhdh/developer-hub-config/values.yaml file in GitLab, window="gitlab"]. OpenShift GitOps will detect changes to this file and redeploy {product_name_rhdh} in response. You can see these two sources in the *Details* tab of the `backstage` Application as shown.

== Platform Engineer Activity: Verify GitOps is Working

*Update the App Title of {product_name_rhdh}*

Let's verify that changes to the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml file in GitLab, window="gitlab"] actually get rolled out by OpenShift GitOps.

. Open your https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe{team-id}/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml file, window="gitlab"].
. Select *Edit > Edit single file*. When prompted, log in as a Platform Engineer with `{pe-username}` / `{common_password}`
. Find the YAML surrounded by `--- APP TITLE ---` and uncomment it by highlighting it and pressing `CMD + /` or `CTRL + /`.
+
image:m2/gitlab-change-app-title.png[Customizing the Title]
. Scroll down and enter a commit message `feat: change application title`.
. Click the *Commit changes* button.


*Verify update to {product_name_rhdh}'s Custom Title*

Let's ensure that a new deployment of {product_name_rhdh} is triggered and your new title is applied.

. Return to the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-{team-id}[Developer Hub Application in Argo CD, window="argo"]. Depending on your timing, it might already be progressing the latest sync, but if not, click the *Refresh* button. When the sync is in progress, you'll see a new Pod starting - this Pod will run the latest version of your configuration.
+
image:m2/rhdh-new-pod.png[{product_name_rhdh} with a Custom Title]

. Once the new Pod has started, visit your https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh} instance, window="rhdh"]. You should see the new title *PE Developer Hub* in the page header.

[NOTE]
====
You may need to log out to see the title change. Click the Guest user icon in the top right corner and select *Sign out*. Then log back in to the https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh} instance, window="rhdh"]  as a Platform Engineer with `{pe-username}` / `{common_password}`.
