== Activity: Enabling GitLab Entity Discovery & TechDocs

include::../style.adoc[]

Now that the import of User and Group entities and authentication is enabled for those same users, let's focus on importing more Entities from your Git repositories. Having a rich and complete Software Catalog increases the value of the your IDP.

=== Enable GitLab Entity Discovery and TechDocs

Much like the Keycloak provider, you can use a https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/gitlab/discovery/[GitLab provider to discover^, window="console"] and import Entities from repositories in GitLab. This functionality is provided by the
https://npmjs.com/package/@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-gitlab/v/0.3.21[@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-gitlab plugin^, window="content"]. You can see that this is a supported https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.5/html/dynamic_plugins_reference/con-preinstalled-dynamic-plugins[dynamic plugin in the {product_name_rhdh} documentation^, window="content"].

To install and configure this plugin:

. Visit the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[rhdh/developer-hub-config repository^, window="gitlab"] in your GitLab instance.
. Select *Edit > Edit single file*.
. Uncomment the `--- TECHDOCS_PLUGIN ---` section in `dynamic.plugins` section of the YAML, to enable the TechDocs and GitLab dynamic plugins.
+
[NOTE]
====
To uncomment multiple lines of code, highlight the lines and press `CMD + /` (on macOS) or `CTRL + /` (on Linux/Windows).

. Look for the YAML between the `--- TECHDOCS_CONFIG ---` block and uncomment it.
+
image:m2/gitlab-techdoc-config.png[TechDocs Config for Local Builder, width=50%]
. Find the `appConfig.catalog.providers` configuration and uncomment the `--- GITLAB_CATALOG_PROVIDER ---` block as shown below. +

// . Verify that you indentation matches that shown in the screenshot,
. Commit your changes with the message `feat: add gitlab autodiscovery`.

. Click the *Refresh* button on the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications[`backstage` Application in OpenShift GitOps^, window="argo"] (login as `admin` / `{openshift_gitops_password}`).

=== Verify GitLab Entity Discovery is Active

. After a few moments your new {product_name_rhdh} configuration will finish rolling out. Check the logs for the new https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/backstage/core%7Ev1%7EPod[{product_name_rhdh} Pod^, window="console"]. You should see that a repository was discovered - that means the repository contains https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format/[catalog-info.yaml, window="blank"] file.
+

. The repository in question is the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/global/global-techdocs[global/global-techdocs^, window="gitlab"]. This repository contains a __catalog-info.yaml__ that defines a Component, and an annotation `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` that tells the TechDocs plugin where to find the source for documentation builds for the Component.
+

. Visit your https://backstage-rhdh-team{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[instance of {product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"] and view the Software Catalog. Make sure that the `Kind` dropdown is set to _Component_. You should see the _global-techdocs_ Component.

=== Viewing TechDocs

. Click the _global-techdocs_ Component name in the Software Catalog, and select the `Docs` tab.
+
image:m2/global-techdocs-component-view.png[Global TechDocs being rendered, width=70%]
. It should compile and render the TechDocs.

. You might have noticed that the side menu has a new *Docs* entry too. This appeared when you enabled the TechDocs plugin!

== TechDocs Generation and Storage Configuration

Recall the `techdocs` configuration from your https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml file in GitLab, window="gitlab"]. It should resemble the following example:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
techdocs:
  builder: 'local'
  publisher:
    type: 'local'
  generator:
    runIn: local
----

This particular configuration is instructing TechDocs to build (`builder`) and store documentation locally (`publisher.type`), in the running {product_name_rhdh} container.

The `generator: local` option instructs TechDocs to build the documentation on-demand. This requires the underlying container to have the necessary dependencies installed - {product_name_rhdh} has these dependencies in place.

It's possible to offload the TechDocs build process to a CI/CD pipeline that uses the TechDocs CLI. In this scenario, the pipeline builds and publishes the TechDocs to https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage/[S3 or other storage solution, window="content"]. The platform engineer must configure a `builder` of type `external` and the `publisher` to read from the same storage system to load the desired TechDocs for a given Entity if an alternative storage solution is used.

Using the `external` builder strategy reduces load on the {product_name_rhdh} instance, but places the burden of building and publishing the TechDocs on authors. Repository owners and authors can build their TechDocs using the https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/cli/[TechDocs CLI, window="content"].

== Safety Checks - Kahoot TIME 

Wrap up the job done to your peers. Explain which capabilities (AuthN / SCM / RBAC) has been added to the internal developer platform

== Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned the core concepts of Backstage and {product_name_rhdh}. You also learned how to deploy and manage an instance of {product_name_rhdh} using the official Helm Chart via OpenShift GitOps.
