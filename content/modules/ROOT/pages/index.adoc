== Introduction


Your mission today is to equip a team of super developers to make them super hero developers!

Many organizations today are facing serious challenges that impact their development teamsâ€™ productivity. High cognitive load, lack of standardization, and fragmented domain knowledge are common issues that lead to inefficiencies, increased maintenance costs, and even security vulnerabilities.

Red Hat provides the tools and know-how to help "The Providers" (Platform Engineers) to create "The Product" (their internal developer portal) based on the needs of "The Customers" (all Development Teams within the organization).

== Team Organization

Today, You will learn how to onboard new team members on an amazing platform. The *Internal Developer Platform (IDP)* ! AKA Platform Engineering. You will be in a team *3 people*. Working closely to embrace severals roles to explore 3 main topics :

* Define the plaftorm engineering in a fictive organization
* Develop and deploy your application leveraging your platform engineering previously created
* Iterate and improve your platform engineering 

The workshop will be paced with *2 different roles*. 


As you will be a team of 3, you will drive parts sometimes *individually* or *together*. Together means someone from the team will own the "execution" of a *"Shared Part"* of the workshop and the rest of team will follow it carefully. Each member will do a *"shared part"* in this session



== Platform Engineer Role 

This workshop is designed for *Platform Engineers* who are in charge of:

* Creating standards for technologies that are used across environments (Development, Testing, Production)
* Defining processes that maximize Development Teams' efficiency by relieving them from platform details.

This workshop can also help Development Teams who are in charge of creating a software solution, and empower them (traditionally speaking) in picking their own tools for coding, building, deploying, running, monitoring, and documentation. Learn how Red Hat transforms the developer onboarding and secures their deliveries from the inner loop to the outer loop seamlessly.
