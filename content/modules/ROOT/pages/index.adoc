== Introduction


Your mission today is to equip a team of super developers to make them super heroe developers !

Many organizations today are grappling with serious challenges that hinder their development teamsâ€™ productivity. High cognitive load, lack of standardization, and fragmented domain knowledge are common issues that lead to inefficiencies, increased maintenance costs, and even security vulnerabilities.

Red Hat provides the tools and know-how to help "The Providers" (Platform Engineers) to create "The Product" (their internal developer portal) based on the needs of "The Customers" (all Development Teams within the organization).

== Team Organization

Today, You will learn how to onboard new team members on an amazing platform. The Developer Internal Platform ! AKA Platform Engineering. You will be *3 people*. Working closely to embrace severals roles to explore 3 main topcis :

* Defining the plaftorm engineering according to existing tools in a fictive organization
* Develop and deploy your application freshly onboarded thanks to your platform engineering previously created
* Take steps back and improve your platform engineering 

The workshop will be paced with *2 different roles*. 
The first is the *Platform Engineer* . It will be in charge to configure the internal developer platform and define templates according to application development requirements.
The second is the *Developer*. It will consume the internal developer platform, produce code and ship it to target environments

As you will be a team of 3, you will drive parts sometimes *individually* or *together*. Together means someone from the team will own the "execution" of a *"Shared Part"* of the workshop and the rest of team will follow it carefully. Each member will do a *"shared part"* in this session



== Platform Engineer Role 

This workshop is designed for *Platform Engineers* who are in charge of:

* Creating standards for technologies that are used across environments (Development, Testing, Production)
* Defining processes that maximize Development Teams' efficiency, by unburdening them from platform details.

This workshop is built in a learn-by-example style, where we show you how to create, set up, and manage an IDP using Red Hat Developer Hub. The workshop is opinionated and should be viewed as an example of how to approach things. As always, make sure you, as a Platform Engineer, build what your customers (Development Teams) need by soliciting early feedback to ensure you're on the right track.

== Developer Role

This workshop can also help *Development Teams* who are in charge of creating a software solution, and empower (traditionally speaking) in picking their own tools for coding, building, deploying, running, monitoring and documentation.
Learn how Red Hat transform the developer onboarding and secure their deliveries from inner loop to the outter loop seamessly 


== Key Takeways

After completing this workshop you'll:

TO COMPLETE WITH OCQ info 
* Understand the need to implement Platform Engineering disciplines within your organization.
* See clear benefits from improving Developer Productivity.
* Be ready to deploy a Thinnest Viable Platform (TVP) based on the needs of the development teams in your organization, and focus on increasing their productivity.
* Assess the investments into your own IDP and understand how it can be enhanced, and convince development teams to start adopting it.
* View Red Hat as a partner in your Platform Engineering journey.
