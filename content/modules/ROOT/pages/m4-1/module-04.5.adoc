== Developer Activity: Work on feature branch
include::../style.adoc[]


In this module, as a Developer you are tasked to make changes to an existing service - the `parasol-store` service. You will create a feature branch of the repository and then work in an ephemeral environment that allows you to work independently without impacting other developers in your team. Once you are ready with the changes, you can raise a merge request to push your changes to main branch, and there progressing the changes to production deployment

IMPORTANT: Please make sure you are logged in as a *Developer* with `{dev-username}` / `{common_password}`.

== Create a Feature Branch

. Click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store[here to access the parasol-store^, window="gitlab"] repository.
. Click on the *(+)* button as shown in the screenshot below, and click on *New branch* menu
+

. Name the branch `my-feature-branch`. The rest of the instructions assume this is the branch name.
+

== Onboard the Feature Branch using template

. Visit your instance of https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"]. If prompted, login as `{dev-username}` / `{common_password}`.
. Select the image:common/plus-icon.png[width=15px] icon on the top navigation bar to access the *Self-service* menu and view the available templates.
. Click *Choose* button on the *Parasol Store Development* template. 
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template.png[width=30%]

. In *Step 1: Provide Information for the sandbox deployment*, enter the feature branch name `my-feature-branch` or the name you have picked for your branch.
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step1.png[]
. In *Step 2: Provide database information*. Keep all the fields as they are - no need to make changes.
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step2.png[]

. Click on *Review*, and proceed to *Create*
+
image:m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step3.png[]

. Click on the *Open component on catalog* link
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-component.png[]


=== Explore the Component

. The newly created component for the ephemeral environment acts as a single pane of glass to perform most of the acivities as a developer
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-component-laanding.png[width=90%]

. Notice that under the *CI* tab, a pipeline is in progress. If this isn't in progress yet, allow a few minutes for the pipeline to kickoff.
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline.png[]
. The pipeline turns green when it finishes the run successfully
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline-success.png[]

. Explore the other tabs to see how {product_name_rhdh} provides a single pane of glass for the Developer's ephemeral dev environment.
.. The *Overview* tab provides easy access to the sourcecode and deployments
.. The *Topology* tab provides a window to the deployment on OpenShift, that gives a developer access to all the deployment parameters, labels and annotations - but also provides *searchable* access to the Pod logs, without the need to switch to OpenShift directly.
+
image:m4/feature-branch-deployment-pod-log.png[]

.. The *Issues and Pull/Merge Requests* tabs provide insights about the GitLab repo
.. *CI* tab shows an easy view of the pipeline in both OpenShift (Tekton based pipeline), and on GitLab
.. The *CD* tab shows the deployed components/systems in the namespace using Argo CD plugin


=== View the  deployment on OpenShift

. To view the deployment on OpenShift, https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/deployments/parasol-store[click here^, window="console"].

[NOTE]
====
Login to OpenShift using the credentials `admin` / `{common_password}`.

== Add Features to the Application

. Click on the *< > View Source* button on the {product_name_rhdh} https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store-my-feature-branch[Component Overview page^, window="rhdh"] to access the source code repository.
+
image:m4/parasol-branch-component-overview.png[]

. Switch to the *my-feature-branch* 
+
image:m4/parasol-switchbranch.png[width=60%]

. The feature request is to provide a REST API call endpoint that returns the total number of available products. For the purposes of this workshop, you will uncomment a block of code.
. Changes are needed in the `parasol-store> src> main> java> org> parasol> retail> store> catalog> rest> CatalogResource.java` file. You can click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/blob/my-feature-branch/src/main/java/org/parasol/retail/store/catalog/rest/CatalogResource.java[here^, window="gitlab"] to directly access this file on GitLab.
. Select *Edit > Edit single file*. If prompted, login as `{dev-username}` / `{common_password}`.
+
image:m4/parasol-webide.png[]

. Right at the bottom of this file, you will find the `getProductCount()` method that's been commented out.
+
image:m4/parasol-commented-prodcount.png[width=85%]
. Carefully delete the these two lines:  `/* DELETE THIS COMMENT LINE` and `DELETE THIS COMMENT LINE */`. This will remove the comments.
. After deletion, the file should look like this
+
image:m4/parasol-un-commented-prodcount.png[]

. Add a Commit Message `Chore: Add ProdCount REST API call` at the bottom of the page; make sure the Target Branch is `my-feature-branch`; Click *Commit changes*
. You can now close the GitLab browser tab.

== View `parasol-store` component on {product_name_rhdh}

. Navigate to `parasol-store-my-feature-branch` component https://backstage-rhdh-{team-id}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/ci[from your {product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"] 
. Access the *CI tab* to view the pipeline.  You will see a new pipeline being triggered for the change you just made.
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline1.png[width=80%]
. Shortly, the pipeline will be marked as *Succeeded*
+
image:m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline-ok.png[width=80%]
+
NOTE: The first pipeline was triggered when you created this branch using the Software Template, and the next is by the Git commit.


== Conclusion

In this module you learned how Software Templates and plugins can accelerate developer productivity. With {product_name_rhdh}, developers have access to all the necessary tools via a single pane of glass, reducing cognitive load.

This marks the end of the inner loop within the ephemeral development environment. In the next section, you will create a merge request to the main branch to initiate the outer loop.
