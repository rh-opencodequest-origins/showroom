== Introduction to Concepts and Module Overview

include::../style.adoc[]

Let's look at a few concepts relevant to using Software Templates to import existing applications. 

=== Catalog Info: A Refresher

You've already seen the magic of the `catalog-info.yaml` file. {product_name_rhdh} can identify and import components based on the presence of a `catalog-info.yaml` file in the repository. This file contains:

* Helpful links
* Ownership information
* Instructions on where to find the TechDocs
* Relationships between the Component and other Entities

With the right plugins, configuration can be added to the `catalog-info.yaml` to show critical information in the Component view on {product_name_rhdh}:

* CI Pipelines
* CD Deployments (as you saw with OpenShift GitOps already!)
* Git Merge/Pull Requests and Issues
* Cluster Details
* API Documentation

=== What is Inner-Loop and Outer-Loop

Application development and deployment cycles can be defined to have an Inner-Loop and an Outer-Loop.

The *Inner Loop* is the iterative development cycle that developers follow when writing, testing, and debugging code _locally_ before integrating it into a shared environment. Developers primarily live within the inner loop. In many organizations, the inner loop typically takes place on a developer's computer. In this workshop the inner loop extends to an ephemeral (or preview) environment (namespace) on OpenShift that allows a developer to test their changes in a production-like environment.

NOTE: An Ephemeral environment is meant to be a transient environment to be used to build specific features, and can be torn down once the feature development is complete

The *Outer Loop*  begins when a developer pushes code to a version control system. It involves integration, validation, compliance and security checks, and deployment to target environments. Typically this is where Platform and DevOps Engineers operate.

The two cycles operate independently, except when the developer pushes code to Git, which triggers the outer loop.

=== An Opinionated Approach

NOTE: Different organizations have different ways of achieving the inner and outer loops. This module is a highly opinionated approach to the inner and outer loops. The primary intent is to showcase the art of the possible with {product_name_rhdh}.

To make the process of importing a large number of existing applications into {product_name_rhdh} scalable, the Platform Engineering (PE) team creates a *Software Template* that automates both the creation of the `catalog-info.yaml` file and a TechDocs skeleton structure for developers.

The necessary Catalog Info and TechDocs could be stored in one of two locations for these existing applications:

. The new files can be added to the same Git repository as the existing source-code.
. Alternatively, a repository containing an Entity of `kind: Location`
 can be created to store a collection of all of the `catalog-info.yaml` and TechDocs files. An Entity of `kind: Location` references other places to look for catalog data.

*Parasol team's approach*

The Parasol team chooses the second approach to avoid adding files to existing source code repositories. 

* They create a dedicated repository called `all-location-parasol` containing a https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format/#kind-location[*Location*, window="content"] file. 
* This `Location` entity serves as a central index, referencing all `catalog-info.yaml` files within the same repository.

``` yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: all-location-parasol
  description: A collection of Parasol components
spec:
  type: url
  target: ./**/catalog-info.yaml
```
* Platform Engineers create Software Templates to import existing APIs, services and apps into {product_name_rhdh}
* Developers can register their components by using these Software Templates. The template auto creates a `catalog-info.yaml` file and a skeleton TechDocs for each component. 
 
{product_name_rhdh} can _auto-discover_ these *Location* files based on the file and repository names (e.g _all-location.yaml_ file in a folder which begins with the word _all-location_ ) across Git. You can also configure a  _schedule_ that defines how often you want it to run. For this workshop we have a super short frequency of 15 seconds. 

But, it is good practice to limit auto-discovery to specific filenames and be judicious with the scheduling frequency to ensure you don't hit API rate limits with your Git hosting provider.

``` yaml
all-location-entity:
    filters:
        branch: main
    entityFilename: all-location.yaml
    catalogPath: /**/all-location.yaml
    projectPattern: \b(all-location\w*)
    schedule:
        frequency:
            seconds: 15
        initialDelay:
            seconds: 15
        timeout:
            minutes: 3
```



=== An Overview of Parasol Application

The Developer is asked to build new features into the existing Parasol application which consists of the following Components:

* `parasol-web` online web-app (Node.js & Angular)
* `parasol-store` core services (Quarkus)
* `parasol-db` core database (PostgreSQL)
* `parasol-api` (OpenAPI Spec)

In the next sections of this module, we will shadow both the Platform Engineers and Developers as they navigate through onboarding existing applications and accelerate the inner-loop leading to increased developer productivity.
