*Time to explore platform engineering for everyone !*


Now our platform engineering has the addtional capabilities such as :

* Authentication with Keycloak 
* Source code management with Gitlab
* Organization and entities  

Your mission is to onboard your developer team to the OpenCode Quest project.


## The application

In this workshop you will develop an application that allows super-heroes to fight against villains.

Being a workshop about microservices, you will be developing several microservices communicating synchronously via REST API endpoints:

- `frontend`: a web application that allows users to pick up a random super-hero, a random villain and makes them fight. The Super Hero UI invokes the Hero, Villain and Fight REST endpoints.
- `hero-service`: a Quarkus microservice that provides CRUD operations on Heroes which are stored in a PostgresSQL database.
- `villain-service`: the counterpart of the hero service, for villains.
- `fight-service`: a microservice that simulates a fight between a hero and a villain. The simulation is done using a _Large Language Model_ (LLM) that is deployed on OpenShift AI/ML Services. The result also includes a short narration of the fight:

## The architecture

Each team member will create a template following the golden rules of the software template. The template is specific to a stack. 
A set of tools will be also configured. Yes you will leverage the integrations done previously ;) 

A template here will have the following structure : 

* Skeleton for the source code repository
* Source code repository
* IDE Cloud
* CI/CD pipeline
* Container image registry repository
* Gitops application

[Add schema to illustrate users split ?]
