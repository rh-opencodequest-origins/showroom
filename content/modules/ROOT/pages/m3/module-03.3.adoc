== Developer Activity: Create a new Component from the Template

IMPORTANT: Please make sure you are logged in as a Developer with {dev-username} / {common_password} as you were guided to in the previous step.

include::../style.adoc[]

Create a new software Component and supporting infrastructure using the *Quarkus Service* template that was created by the platform engineer:
NOTE: Remember, this template has been generated by an AI. Use it carefully ;) 

=== Explore the Template
. Access https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh}^, window="rhdh"].
. Click the *Create* icon (plus symbol) in the top menu.
+

. Click the *Choose* button on the *Quarkus Service*. The Template parameters collection screen will be displayed.

. Oups ! This is a template generated by an *amazing over-trained AI model*.. Hopefully, you are enough smart to correct the work did by the dummy AI !

. In Step 1, "Prompt me something". Yes , it's not releavant at all 
  * OpenShift version is not useful to onboard a developer. You should modify the template

=== Update the Template with a human touch !

. Click on the 3 dots button as shown on the picture
+

Remember Templates imported previously are located in Gitlab. We will directly edit it and commit it !

*Update the titles of form inputs*


. Find the YAML surrounded by `update the title below` and replace the title

image:m3/template-quarkus-pg-edit-title.png

  * *Prompt me something* by *OpenShift Cluster URL*


. Scroll down and enter a commit message `feat: change application title`.
. Click the *Commit changes* button.

*Refresh the template updated ...*

Templates are refreshed asynchronously by Red Hat Developer Hub. We will see how to refresh it manually.

Let's find the template to refresh !

. Step *1* - Click on *Catalog*
. Step *2* - Select *Template* type
. Step *3* - Choose the template to refresh

Let's refresh the template !

. Click on *circle arrows*

NOTE: The template definition is tied to its definition in the git repository. No GitOps mecanism involved here



*Explore a true step definition*

Remember, the platform engineering helps developers to integrate development tools configured seamessly in a project. To do so, we rely on plugins to do the job. it proposes a set of *actions*
For instance, to create a simple Gitlab repository, we use the concept of *action*    

```yaml
 - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
      input:
        repoUrl: "${{ parameters.repo.host }}.${{ parameters.openshiftCluster }}?owner=${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}&repo=${{parameters.component_id}}"
        repoVisibility: public
```
The *repoUrl* is built with informations set in the form. The repository will be created with in Gitlab user space *user.entity.metadata.name* and the repository name will be *component_id* set in the Java Package Information section


*Explore the Software Catalog AKA catalog-info.yaml*


As the platform engineering is the entrypoint for project developments, get the right overview of objects created, integrations performed is paramount !
This is why the *Sofware Catalog* exists ! A clear definition of UI elements based on external tools involved in the development project. For instance, pipeline status, source code repositories, registry shortcuts ...

```yaml
 - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        repoContentsUrl: ${{ steps.publish.output.repoContentsUrl }}
        catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
```
The template creates a *Software Catalog* thanks to this action in the git repository where your project will live. It will be updatable by developers. We will see how later ..
Check the content here : -> https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/blob/main/template.yaml[template.yaml, window="gitlab"].


Link to Module 02.1 maybe ?
Find more informations about the sofware catalog : https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.6/html/customizing_red_hat_developer_hub/about-software-catalogs 






=== Inspect the new Component and Container Image

Click the *Open Component in catalog* link to view the new `my-quarkus-component` Component. 

You'll see links to the GitLab repository (*View Source* link) and note that you're listed as the owner since your identity was passed to the skeleton code used to create the https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{dev-username}/my-quarkus-app/-/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml?ref_type=heads[Component's *catalog-info.yaml* file, window="gitlab"]. 

NOTE: You can see the user identity `values` being passed to the `fetch:template` action in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/blob/main/template.yaml[template.yaml, window="gitlab"].

image:m3/rhdh-new-component.png[A successful template run in {product_name_rhdh}]

Select the *CI* tab to view the status of the OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) build. It might take a moment or two for the currently to appear in the *Pipeline Runs* pane. The Pipeline Run is triggered by a set of build manifests that were created in a separate GitOps repository from the Quarkus application's source code - you can find the manifests in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{dev-username}/my-quarkus-app-gitops/-/tree/main/helm/quarkus-build[helm/quarkus-build, window="gitlab"] folder. The GitOps Application responsible for applying the build manifests can be seen in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{dev-username}/my-quarkus-app-gitops/-/blob/main/argocd/argocd-app-dev-build.yaml[*argocd/argocd-app-dev-build.yaml*, window="gitlab"] file that was added to Argo CD by the `argocd:create-resources` action in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/blob/main/template.yaml[*template.yaml*, window="gitlab"].

NOTE: Manifests related to the developer's applications are managed by a second instance of OpenShift GitOps named *rhdh-gitops*. This second instance is used to manage Parasol's development team's applications, whereas the OpenShift GitOps instance you accessed earlier manages platform components - including the second instance of OpenShift GitOps. View the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications?search=rhdh[rhdh-gitops ArgoCD Application^, window="argo"] by logging in to the *primary* OpenShift GitOps instance using `admin` / `{openshift_gitops_password}`.

Wait for the build to complete, and visit the https://quay.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/user/{dev-username}/[{dev-username} organization in Quay^, window="quay"]. You'll be able to view the new _my-quarkus-app_ repository and see the newly pushed _latest_ image tag.

=== Summary

Nice work! You created a new Component and associated source code from a Software Template.

In the next section you'll learn how to enable and disable different plugin integrations with your Components, using OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD) as an example.
